          <h3>Unreal</h3>
          <p>The Unreal Engine has been my main program for game design due to visual coding. I have worked on several projetcs on Unreal inclding a
             3D platformer and a FPS. I've been trying to leanr C++ so that I can widen my area into other programs. But whatever game it is, I know that I can make it look prettier with good light sources
           and particle effects!</p>

          <h3 class="skills-text">Unity</h3>
          <p class="skills-text">I have also worked on many experimental projects on Unity so my layout experience is just as good as my Unreal knowledge. I've made interactive 2D platformer scenes as well as
          some 3D environments. I have experience on making and exporting pixel art and other 2D assets such as animation and tileable blocks!</p>

        <h3>Photoshop</h3>
        <p>Photoshop has been my go to program for nearly all the digital 2D work I produce. I have good skills on various areas of photoshop including photograph editing, color correction, asset production and whatever you might like!
